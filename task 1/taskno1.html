    <h1>Fall of Constantinople</h1>
    <div>
        <i>
            <p>
                The <b>fall of Constantinople</b>, also known as the <b>conquest of Constantinople</b>, was the capture
                of
                the capital of the Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman Empire.
                The city was captured on 29 May 1453 as part of the culmination of a 53-day siege which had begun on 6
                April.
            </p>
            <p>
                The attacking Ottoman Army, which significantly outnumbered Constantinople's defenders, was commanded by
                the
                21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II (later nicknamed "the Conqueror"),
                while the Byzantine army was led by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. After conquering the city,
                Mehmed II
                made Constantinople the new Ottoman capital, replacing Adrianople.
            </p>
            <p>
                he fall of Constantinople and of the Byzantine Empire was a watershed of the Late Middle Ages, marking
                the
                effective end of the Roman Empire, a state which began in roughly 27 BC and had lasted nearly 1500
                years.
                For many modern historians, the fall of Constantinople marks the end of the medieval period and the
                beginning of the early modern period. The city's fall also stood as a turning point in military
                history. Since ancient times, cities and castles had depended upon ramparts and walls to repel invaders.
                The
                Walls of Constantinople, especially the Theodosian Walls, were some of the most advanced defensive
                systems
                in the world at the time. For 800 years, the Theodosian Walls, regarded by historians as the strongest
                and
                most fortified walls in the ancient and medieval era, protected Constantinople from attack. However,
                these fortifications were overcome with the use of gunpowder, specifically from Ottoman cannons and
                bombards, heralding a change in siege warfare. The Ottoman cannons repeatedly fired massive cannonballs
                weighing 500 kilograms (1,100 lb) over 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) which created gaps in the Theodosian
                Walls
                for the Ottoman siege.
            </p>
            <h2>The Byzantine Empire</h2>
            <p>
                Constantinople had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor
                Constantine
                the Great. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been besieged many times but was captured
                only
                once before: the Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. The crusaders established an
                unstable Latin state in and around Constantinople while the remainder of the Byzantine Empire splintered
                into a number of successor states, notably Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond. They fought as allies against
                the
                Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.
            </p>

            <p>

                The Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine
                Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as
                it
                fended off successive attacks by the Latins, Serbs, Bulgarians and Ottoman Turks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Between 1346 and 1349, the Black Death killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople. The city
                was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453, it
                consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century
                Theodosian
                Walls.
            </p>
            <p>
                By 1450, the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometers outside the city of
                Constantinople itself, the Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara and the Peloponnese with its cultural
                center at Mystras. The Empire of Trebizond, an independent successor state that formed in the aftermath
                of
                the Fourth Crusade, was also present at the time on the coast of the Black Sea.
            </p>
            <h2>Siege</h2>
            <p>
                At the beginning of the siege, Mehmed sent out some of his best troops to reduce the remaining Byzantine
                strongholds outside the city of Constantinople. The fortress of Therapia on the Bosphorus and a smaller
                castle at the village of Studius near the Sea of Marmara were taken within a few days. The Princes'
                Islands in the Sea of Marmara were taken by Admiral Baltoghlu's fleet. Mehmed's massive cannons
                fired on the walls for weeks but due to their imprecision and extremely slow rate of fire, the
                Byzantines were able to repair most of the damage after each shot, mitigating the effect of the Ottoman
                artillery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite some probing attacks, the Ottoman fleet under Baltoghlu could not enter the Golden Horn due to
                the chain across the entrance. Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any foreign ships
                from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April, a small flotilla of four Christian ships managed to get in
                after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused
                embarrassment to the Sultan. Baltoghlu was most likely injured in the eye during the
                skirmish. Mehmed stripped Baltoghlu of his wealth and property and gave it to the janissaries and
                ordered him to be whipped 100 times.
            </p>
            <p>

                Mehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across Galata on the north side of the Golden
                Horn and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain
                barrier. This action seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the nominally
                neutral colony of Pera and it demoralized the Byzantine defenders. On the night of 28 April, an attempt
                was made to destroy the Ottoman ships already in the Golden Horn using fire ships but the Ottomans
                forced the Christians to retreat with many casualties. Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and
                swam to the northern shore. On orders of Mehmed, they were impaled on stakes, in sight of the city's
                defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman
                prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the
                Ottomans. With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to
                disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.

                    <p>
                        The Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but they
                        were
                        costly failures. Venetian surgeon Niccol√≤ Barbaro, describing in his diary one such land attack
                        by
                        the Janissaries, wrote
                    </p>

                <dd>
                    <p>

                        They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the
                        Janissaries
                        ... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones
                        ...
                        without caring how near they came to the city walls. Our men shot at them with guns and
                        crossbows,
                        aiming at the Turk who was carrying away his dead countryman, and both of them would fall to the
                        ground
                        dead, and then there came other Turks and took them away, none fearing death, but being willing
                        to let
                        ten of themselves be killed rather than suffer the shame of leaving a single Turkish corpse by
                        the
                        walls.

                Siege of Constantinople as depicted between 1470 and 1479
                After these inconclusive attacks, the Ottomans sought to break through the walls by constructing tunnels
                to mine them from mid-May to 25 May. Many of the sappers were miners of Serbian origin sent from Novo
                Brdo under the command of Zagan Pasha. An engineer named Johannes Grant, a German who came with the
                Genoese contingent, had counter-mines dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the
                miners. The Byzantines intercepted the first tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels
                were interrupted on 21, 23 and 25 May, and destroyed with Greek fire and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the
                Byzantines captured and tortured two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish
                tunnels, which were destroyed.

                On 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him
                the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their
                possessions. He would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed the
                safety of the population that might choose to remain in the city. Constantine XI only agreed to pay
                higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the
                hands of the Turks as Ottoman possessions. The Emperor was not willing to leave the city without a
                fight:
            </p>
                </dt>
                <dd>
            <p>
                As to surrendering the city to you, it is not for me to decide or for anyone else of its citizens; for
                all of us have reached the mutual decision to die of our own free will, without any regard for our
                lives.
            </p>
             </dd>
            </dl>

            <p> Around this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers. Here he encountered some
                resistance; one of his Viziers, the veteran Halil Pasha, who had always disapproved of Mehmed's plans to
                conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege in the face of recent adversity. Zagan Pasha
                argued against Halil Pasha and insisted on an immediate attack. Believing that the Byzantine defence was
                already weakened sufficiently, Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force and started
                preparations for a final all-out offensive.
